# radio-parsing
This repository is meant to store my progress parsing and analyzing data available from the available DJ playlists (including my own) at wprb.com
Currently, given a DJ's name and playlist page, this code can retrieve a csv of every song (+ its corresponding artist and release) played by the DJ. 
There is also functionality to find a DJ's top artists as well as the DJs who have played a given artist the most. 

It should be noted that this project is in very early stages, and there are many places where it can be optimized and refined. Code is uploaded now for those interested in parsing data from their own radio stations. 

There are also several further directions to go with this project, including a radio version of Spotify's "Wrapped" feature.
